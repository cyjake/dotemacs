Jake's Vim Configurations
=========================

I started using vim since 2005, but never fancy the style of it.
Editing with so many modes isn't so intuitive to me, at least at first.

Then Emacs came to me, with [pluskid](http://blog.pluskid.org)'s 
emacs configurations. After almost 5 years of Muse, EMMS, 
my fingers gave up finally when they have to press some key bindings 
like `C-c ; f c` to find some controller in a rails project.

I'd rather type `:Rcontroller` instead.
